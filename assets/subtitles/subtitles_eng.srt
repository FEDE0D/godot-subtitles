Hi, I’m Joe from the <b>Gaming Accessibility 
Team at Xbox.</b>

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,960
2021 was such a [wave amp=50 freq=2]great year for gaming accessibility[/wave]
– and we can’t wait to see the progress

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,460
that’ll be made in [rainbow freq=0.2 sat=10 val=20]2022[/rainbow].

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,860
Here are the top 5 tips to keep in mind when
creating accessible games this year.

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,919
Number 1 – Plan ahead!

6
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:24,679
Define your accessibility goals early on in
the product lifecycle.

7
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:30,539
Truly accessible gaming experiences are built
by design, and not as last-minute add-ons.

8
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,450
This means that additional features added
later on in the development cycle to fix inaccessible

9
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,880
designs are not always effective for players.

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,760
Number 2 – Don’t design yourself into
a corner!

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,461
Let’s say your team wants to ensure that
players can scale text up to 200% (which you

12
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:53,220
should!), but during development, your game
is hard coded to the default text size – meaning

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,280
once text is scaled, the UI breaks.

14
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,500
By using variables as often as possible in
your programming, and creating mockups of

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,409
the extreme variables to make sure they’re
going to work, you can save a lot of time

16
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:08,540
and deliver an experience that works.

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,270
Number 3 – Think about who you may be excluding.

18
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,450
For example, if you make a choice to require
quick, repetitive button choices on the controller

19
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:22,109
as a core mechanic of your game, you may unintentionally
exclude players who cannot physically perform

20
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:23,560
those actions.

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,880
In contrast, if you allow players to customize
the input type for certain actions, like introducing

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,729
other options such as “quick button hold,”
or allowing players to skip rapid button presses,

23
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:36,210
this will help eliminate barriers.

24
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,570
Number 4 – Partner with the gaming and disability
community.

25
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,829
If you don’t know whether or not your design
decisions might be excluding groups of players,

26
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:50,149
you can work with disabled gamers who can
help you find ways to eliminate the barriers.

27
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:53,079
Number 5 – Test early and test often!

28
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:58,420
When it comes to accessibility, it’s important
to identify barriers to access as early as

29
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,310
possible in order to allow time to properly
build solutions.

30
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,810
While it can seem tempting to wait until a
playable build of the game is ready to gather

31
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,610
feedback, at this point, it might be too late
to implement the nature of feedback you may

32
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,790
get from the gaming and disability community.

33
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,830
Let’s recap.

34
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,129
Number 1, Plan ahead.

35
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:23,640
Number 2, Don’t design yourself into a corner.

36
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,319
Number 3, Think about who you may be excluding.

37
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:31,159
Number 4, Partner with the gaming and disability
community.

38
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:34,420
And number 5, Test early and often.

39
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,299
Let’s make 2022 the best year for accessible
gaming.

40
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:39,189
Thanks for watching!
